Data message. From arduino to pc:
byte 4:  1  (to tell it is a data message)
byte 5:  potentiometer value between 0 and 99
byte 6:  light sensor value between 0 and 99
byte 7:  termometer value in degrees + 100  (to cover negative values)
byte 8:  the values of the 4 buttons: bit 1 is button 1, bit 2 is button 2 etc.
         So 1010 means: button 1 = down, 2 = up, 3 = down, 4 = up.
